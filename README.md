# 99balloons
ðŸŽˆâŒ–ðŸŽ¯âŒ– Balloon shooting game

## Intro

As I become interested in computer graphics and computer games, I want to develop a balloon shooting game. A player shoots balloons that start from the bottom of the screen. The balloons are flying until they either break or reach the top of the screen. If a balloon hits the top, the game is over. When the player hits the balloon, then the score is incremented. The initial location of the balloon is random. The level number increases after breaking the 99th balloon. In the next level, the balloon's speed increases. The player wins when the player reaches level 99. Graphics include a balloon, crosshair, and a sky. Sound is MIDI music, as well as a balloon popping sound.
